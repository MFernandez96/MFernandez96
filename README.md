# Welcome to my github profile!
Hi there, Martin here!. I am a backend dev from Cordoba, Argentina. I went from accounting, to data, to back. Currently I am under contract for Seenka but I still try to do some freelancing or hobby projects; there is always time for a little challenge. If you are interested in some of my work, feel free to contact me on gmail or linkedin.


### What do I want to do?
I would like to take on C++ and help on some Unreal Engine problems, but I want to improve my python as much as possible; it's a good programming language. I can think about learning some Java or Golang.

### What did I do?
I try to upload what I can on these repos, but honestly it's too hard to keep looking for sensitive information or clean code if it's just for show. One of these is a lot of data cleaning for a car database and there is a lot of work outside github (db design for example); another is early staging of API integration; the rest are various one-use cases.

## Who did I help?
### Seenka | 2021 - Now
- Integrated Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs). 
- Refactor old code.
- Maintain various Django APIs on a microservices structure.

### LFG Labs (AKA Yalm) | 2019 - Now
- Various collabs on the technical side.

### Freelance | 2019 - Now
- Scripting in general, honor mention: Adobe Premiere bot. Proof that any monotonous task can be automatized; this work involved reading a library from its source with no documentation or examples.
- Scraping.
- web3, honor mention: Dropshipping if wallet has NFT.

### Promotive | 2020-2021
- Data cleaning.
- MySQL design and implementation.

## Extras
ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on Django.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity.


ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something related to geek culture.
