# Welcome to my github profile!
  Hi there, Martin here!. I am a backend dev from Cordoba, Argentina. I went from accounting, to data, to back. Currently I am under contract for Vexels but I still try to do some freelancing or hobby projects; there is always time for a little challenge. If you are interested in some of my work, feel free to contact me on gmail or linkedin.


### What do I want to do?
  I'm considering specializing in backend development, possibly delving into a more static language like Golang. Alternatively, I'm thinking about deepening my expertise in frontend, given my current experience with Next.js, or even venturing into video game development.

### What did I do?
  - Developed microservices utilizing the Django framework in conjunction with DRF (Django Rest Framework).
  - Engaged in full-stack development using Next.js.
  - Implemented AWS Lambdas with JavaScript.
  - Executed extensive web scraping using tools such as Selenium, Requests, and Scrapy.
  - Conducted data cleaning using the Python's pandas library.
  - Managed and maintained some legacy PHP systems.
  - Worked with a variety of databases, both SQL (including Postgres and BigQuery) and NoSQL (spanning Elastic, Mongo, Clickhouse, Dynamo, and Redis).
  - Gained proficiency in cloud platforms, primarily AWS and GCP.
